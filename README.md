# DevOps KC Meetups

Repo for the DevOps KC meetups, where we'll track planning, ideas, content, etc.

## About Us

The DevOps KC Meetup is a group targeted to engineers (both dev and ops), tech professionals, managers, leads, architects, and entrepreneurs - so really pretty broad! ðŸ˜„ The goal is always to come together to learn about and share information on DevOps processes, tools, practices, and benefits.
